        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>1. COLLECTED INFORMATION</p>
        <p2>
            The information we collect and store from you includes the following:
            <ul>-> Microsoft Account Data (Access and Refresh Tokens)</ul>
            <ul>-> Server ID</ul>
            <ul>-> Channel ID's</ul>
            <ul>-> Role ID's</ul>
            <ul>-> Realms Name</ul>
            <ul>-> Realms ID</ul>
            <ul>-> Club ID</ul>
            <ul>-> Realm Player Data (xuid's, devices, gamerpic)</ul>
        </p2>
        <p>2. WHY WE COLLECT THIS</p>
        <p2>
            The data listed above is collected for various reasons, breaking down each as follows:
            <ul>-> Your Access and Refresh Tokens are used to authenticate with both Xbox and Minecraft Services. These are required to manage your realm from Discord.</ul>
            <ul>-> Your Server ID is collected to index our Database to update your Server's stored data. It's also used to reference the same data when it's needed later.</ul>
            <ul>-> Your Channel ID's are collected so that the bot may properly send logs to specific channels you set as logs.</ul>
            <ul>-> Your Role ID's are collected so that the bot may properly check a user's roles for the correct permissions to certain commands.</ul>
            <ul>-> Your Realm's name is collected for cosmetic purposes (inside the string menus it looks better to see "NoVa's Realm" than "1234565")</ul>
            <ul>-> Your Realm's ID is collected as a unqiue identifier for that specific realm, to establish connections, and execute management (/realm) commands.</ul>
            <ul>-> Your Club ID is collected for further processing of Realm Players, as well as for other bot features to work properly.</ul>
            <ul>-> Your Realm Players are processed to improve our algorithim for detections, keep track of potentially harmful players, and for the AutoMod to properly work.</ul>
        </p2>
        <p>3. DATA SECURITY / MANAGEMENT</p>
        <p2>
            All of your data is stored inside an encrypted database for maximum security. This data is not looked at by anyone and upon first retrieval it's immediately stored. You may access your currently stored data at anytime by contacting us in our <a href="https://discord.gg/Zh6SW8bZqg">Support Server</a>. You may also delete your data at anytime by using the bot's /disconnect command (for all data), /unlink command (for Microsoft data), or removing Realms+ from your server (all data removed).
        </p2>
        <p>4. CONTACTING SUPPORT</p>
        <p2>
            If you want to contact support as a means to delete your data, you may do so by opening a ticket inside our <a href="https://discord.gg/Zh6SW8bZqg">Support Server</a>.

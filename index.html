          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

          <h2>1. COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
          <p>
            The information we collect and store from you includes the
            following:
          </p>
          <p>1. Microsoft Account Data (Access and Refresh Tokens)</p>
          <p>2. Server ID</p>
          <p>3. Channel ID's</p>
          <p>4. Role ID's</p>
          <p>5. Realms Name</p>
          <p>6. Realms ID</p>
          <p>7. Club ID</p>
          <p>8. Realm Player Data (xuid's, devices, gamerpic)</p>

          <h2>2. WHY WE COLLECT THIS</h2>
          <p>
            The data listed above is collected for various reasons, breaking
            down each as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Your Access and Refresh Tokens are used to authenticate with both
            Xbox and Minecraft Services. These are required to manage your realm
            from Discord.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Your Server ID is collected to index our Database to update your
            Server's stored data. It's also used to reference the same data when
            it's needed later.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Your Channel ID's are collected so that the bot may properly send
            logs to specific channels you set as logs.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Your Role ID's are collected so that the bot may properly check a
            user's roles for the correct permissions to certain commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Your Realm's name is collected for cosmetic purposes (inside the
            string menus it looks better to see "NoVa's Realm" than "1234565").
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Your Realm's ID is collected as a unique identifier for that
            specific realm, to establish connections, and execute management
            (/realm) commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. Your Club ID is collected for further processing of Realm
            Players, as well as for other bot features to work properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            8. Your Realm Players are processed to improve our algorithm for
            detections, keep track of potentially harmful players, and for the
            AutoMod to properly work.
          </p>

          <h2>3. DATA SECURITY / MANAGEMENT</h2>
          <p>
            All of your data is stored inside an encrypted database for maximum
            security. This data is not looked at by anyone and upon first
            retrieval it's immediately stored. You may access your currently
            stored data at anytime by contacting us in our
            <a href="https://discord.gg/Zh6SW8bZqg">Support Server</a>. You may
            also delete your data at anytime by using the bot's /disconnect
            command (for all data), /unlink command (for Microsoft data), or
            removing Realms+ from your server (all data removed).
          </p>

          <h2>4. CONTACTING SUPPORT</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to contact support as a means to delete your data, you
            may do so by opening a ticket inside our
            <a href="https://discord.gg/Zh6SW8bZqg">Support Server</a>.
